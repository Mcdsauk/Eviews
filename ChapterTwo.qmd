# **Basic Data Exploration**

## Performing descriptive statistics on time series data

In the previous chapter, the process of creating a new workfile and importing data into eviews was demonstrated. Visit chapter one of the material if you have not done so.

We will open the stockindex workfile we save in the previous chapter. The workfile contains timeseries data on various stock indixes from different stock markets.

### Open an Existing Workfile

1.  Click file , New, Workfile

2.  Open the stockindex workfile created

![](images/openworkfile.png)

3.  A pop up window appears as shown below. brow to the location of stockindex file

4.  click on the stockindex file (the name may differ on you computer, depending on the name you saved as).

![](images/openworkfile2.png)

5.  click on open to open the work file.

![](images/saveworkfile3.png)

now the data file (stockindex) has been imported and we are ready to run the descriptive statistics. You will notice that the workfile consists of several objects including brent, canada, usa, gold sa, france, china as well as resid and c - the constant which were generated automatically when the work file was created. each object contains the data for the variable it is named with. for instant the object gold, contains the data for the variable called gold. This test will compute statistics such as mean median, mode, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness and others.

### **Step 2: View Your Data**

the first step is to view any one of the variables you intend to compute the statistics for.

1.  move your mouse cursor to the variable of interest and right click on the variable.

2.  Click on open.

3.  In the workfile window, you'll see your dataset loaded as a spreadsheet. You can scroll through the data to get a sense of its structure and content.

**Step 3: Descriptive Statistics for Numeric Variables**

From the page displaying the data contained in the object "gold", do the following to implement descriptive statistics:

1.  click on view , descriptive statistics & test , Histogram & stats

![](images/descriptive1.png)

Alternatively:

1.  Go to "View" , "Quick" , "Descriptive Statistics." , Histogram & Stats

    ![](images/descriptive2-01.png)

2.  The descriptive statistics is displayed below in the dialog box below.

![](images/descriptive3result.png)

Click on

Alternatively, this step depends on the version of EViews you are using

1.  Choose the statistics you want to compute, such as mean, median, standard deviation, variance, skewness, kurtosis, etc.
2.  Click the "OK" button to generate the descriptive statistics table.

### **Step 4: Descriptive Statistics for Categorical Variables**

1.  If you have categorical variables (e.g., a variable with categories like "Yes" or "No"), you can create frequency tables to summarize them.
2.  Go to "View" , "Quick" , "Frequency."
3.  Select the categorical variable you want to analyze.
4.  Click the "OK" button to generate a frequency table.

### **Step 5: Histograms and Graphical Summaries**

This step is for EViews 14

1.  To visualize the distribution of numeric variables, you can create histograms and other graphical summaries.

2.  Go to "Graph" , "Create" , "Histogram."

3.  Select the variable you want to create a histogram for and configure the settings as desired.

Click "OK" to generate the histogram.

**Step 6: Summary Statistics for Time Series Data**

1.  If you're working with time series data, you can generate summary statistics such as autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation.

2.  Go to "Quick" , sieries statistics , "Auto/Partial Auto-Correlation."

3.  Select the time series variable you want to analyze.

4.  Configure the lag values and options, then click "OK" to generate the statistics.

### **Step 7: Exporting Results**

1.  You can export your descriptive statistics or graphical summaries by going to "File" , "Export" and selecting your desired file format (e.g., Excel, text).

2.  Save the file in your preferred location.

These steps cover basic descriptive statistics in EViews. Depending on your specific analysis requirements, you can explore more advanced statistical tools and techniques available in EViews for a deeper understanding of your data.

## Visualizing time series data using charts and graphs.

Visualizing time series data using charts and graphs is an essential step in exploring and understanding the underlying patterns, trends, and anomalies in your data. In EViews, you can create various types of time series charts and graphs to visually represent your data. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to visualize time series data using charts and graphs in EViews:

### **Step 1: Load Your Time Series Data**

1.  Open EViews.

2.  Load your time series data by going to "File" , "Open" and selecting your EViews workfile containing the time series data.

### **Step 2: Create a Line Chart**

A line chart is a fundamental visualization for time series data. It displays data points connected by lines, making it easy to observe trends and fluctuations over time.

1.  Click on "Quick" in the main menu.

2.  Select "Graph" , "Line Graph."

![](images/graphimport1.png)

1.  In the "Line Graph" dialog box:

    -   Choose the time series variable you want to visualize as the "Series."

![](images/graphimport3.png)

-   Specify the X-axis variable (usually, the time variable).

-   Customize chart settings like title, axis labels, and appearance.

-   Click "OK" to generate the line chart.

### **Step 3: Create a Scatter Plot**

A scatter plot is useful for visualizing the relationship between two time series variables. You can use it to assess correlations and potential patterns.

1.  Click on "Quick" in the main menu.

2.  Select "Graph" , type any two variables you intend to plot. Note that the variable name must be exact with the name on the workfile.

![](images/scatterplot2.png)

1.  In the "Scatter Plot" dialog box:

    -   Choose the two time series variables for the X-axis and Y-axis.

    -   Customize chart settings like title, axis labels, and appearance.

![](images/correlation1.png)

-   Click "OK" to generate the scatter plot.

### **Step 4: Create Other Types of Graphs**

EViews offers additional types of graphs, such as bar charts, box plots, and more. You can explore these options to visualize your time series data from different perspectives.

-   **Load or Enter Data**:

    Open EViews and load your data into a workfile.

-   **Select Your Series**:

    -   Identify the time series data you want to plot. Ensure it's available in your workfile.

-   **Create a Line Graph**:

    -   Click on "Quick" in the top menu and type the variable name you want to plot on a graph in the 'series list' dialog box.

![](images/graphimport1-01.png)

-   In the graph dialog, under "Graph type," select "Line" for a line graph.

<!-- -->

-   **Choose Series**:

    -   In the "Series List" dialog box, type the data series you want to plot. You can also select additional series for multiple lines on the graph. In this case we select multiple variables: brent canada china france gold sa usa

    -   Click ok

![](images/linegraphimport.png)

-   from the graph option dialog box, select line & symbols in the specific section as shown below

![](images/linegraphimport2.png)

-   click ok to multiple timeseries plot is displayed

![](images/linegraphimport3multiple.png)

-   repeat the process and this time select multiple

-   note the in the graph options dialog box below, you can select different kinds of graphs and plots including Bar, spike, area, area bank, mixed, dotplot eror bar among many others

![](images/linegraphimportmultiple2.png)

-   click on multipl graphs

-   click ok to display the multiple graphs

![](images/linegraphmultiple3.png)

you can copy and paste any of the graphs into your Microsoft word file

other plots you can make from the same process and steps by choosing the option of your choices:
