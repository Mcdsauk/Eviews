## Setting up a New Project in EViews

Setting up a new project in EViews involves several steps:

**Step 1:** Launch EViews: Windows: After successfully installing EViews on a Windows-based system, follow these steps to launch it:

Click on the Windows Start button in the lower-left corner of your screen. In the search bar, type "EViews" or "EViews 12" (the version number may vary depending on your installation). You should see EViews listed as an application. Click on it to launch the program.

Mac: EViews is primarily a Windows application, so running it directly on macOS is not supported. However, you can run EViews on macOS using virtualization software like Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion, which allows you to run Windows on your Mac and then install and launch EViews within the Windows environment.

**Step 2:** Create a New Workfile

Click on "File" in the menu bar

-   Select "New" and then "Workfile."

-   In the "Create Workfile" dialogue box, give your workfile a name in the WF space.

    ![](images/dataDialogueMonth-01.png)

-   Choose the frequency of your data (e.g., yearly, quarterly, monthly).

-   Set the start and end date or period for your data.

-   Click "OK" to create the workfile. After clicking on ok, the newly created work file is shown below. The workfile is created to accommodate monthly timeseries data from January (month 1) 1980 to December (month 12) 2021. There are two objects within the workfile area, the residual (written as resid) and the constant (c). The two objects will always appear automatically whenever a new workfile is created.

**Step 3:** Import or Enter Data:

Now that you have a workfile, you can add data to it. There are several ways to do this. Follow the steps below to import timeseries data into EViews.

Click on "File" in the menu bar.

![Import Data for File](images/2023-10-06_03-01-50.png)

-   Select "Import" and choose the file format of your data (e.g., Excel, text). in this case the file we are importing is from an excel file.

![](images/rename2.png)

-   to rename a variable, right click on the variable to rename,

![](images/rename1-01.png)

-   click on rename, type the new variable name. in this case the variable brent is renamed oil_price. An underscore (\_) is added because eviews does not allow a space in variable names.

-   In the next text box you can enter a description of the variable that has been renamed. In this case since brent is an international oil price, this will be indicated as the description for the variable. however, it is optional. The variable can still be renamed without providing a description.

-   press enter key on your keyboard.

![](images/rename4.png)

-   save your work file on your computer to enable you reuse the document in future. If the workfile is properly saved, you can open it and work on it and save to update the changes made.

-   while the workfile you want to save is still open

-   Click on file

-   Click on saveas as shown in the picture below

![](images/saveworkfile1.png)

-   A popup appears. Browse for the location you intend to save the workfile. Select a location you can remember. this is because you will need to get to that same location when ever you need to reuse the workfile.

-   The file name textbar on the pop up window, type a name for the workfile you created. In this case, since the workfile contains data on various stock prices, the file is named stockindex.

-   Click save

-   ![](images/saveworkfile2.png)

-   The file is saved.

-   You can alway browse to the location you chose to save the workfile, double click on it to open it in case you desire to use it in future.
