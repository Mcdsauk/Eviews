**Cointegration Analysis: Introduction and Its Importance**

Cointegration analysis is a statistical technique used in time series analysis to investigate the long-term relationship between two or more non-stationary variables. It plays a critical role in econometrics, finance, and various fields, providing insights into the relationships among variables that evolve over time. This article introduces cointegration and explores its importance in data analysis and modeling.

**What Is Cointegration?**

**Cointegration** 
is a concept introduced by economists Robert Engle and Clive Granger in the early 1980s. It addresses the issue of spurious regression, where two or more non-stationary time series variables may appear to be related when analyzed together, but they are not truly dependent on each other in the long run.

In cointegration, the primary idea is that while individual time series variables may be non-stationary (i.e., they do not have a constant mean or variance), there exists a linear combination of these variables that is stationary. This means that although each variable may exhibit trends or stochastic behavior, there is a stable, long-term relationship among them.

**Importance of Cointegration**

Cointegration analysis is important for several reasons:

**Avoiding Spurious Relationships**

Cointegration helps distinguish between true, meaningful relationships and spurious correlations that may occur when analyzing non-stationary variables together. It prevents misleading conclusions in regression analysis.

**Long-Term Relationships**

Cointegration identifies long-term relationships among variables, which is especially valuable in economic and financial modeling. For example, it can reveal equilibrium relationships between variables like supply and demand or interest rates and inflation.

**Granger Causality**

Cointegration is closely related to Granger causality. If two variables are cointegrated, it suggests the possibility of bidirectional causality, where changes in one variable can influence the other in the long run.

**Hedging and Portfolio Management**

In finance, cointegration can be used for pair trading strategies. Traders identify pairs of stocks or assets that are cointegrated and trade the spread between them, taking advantage of mean-reversion tendencies.

**Econometric Modeling**

Cointegration is fundamental for modeling economic relationships, such as the Fisher Effect in economics or the Law of One Price in international trade. It helps create more accurate and robust models.

**Forecasting**

Cointegrated variables often exhibit predictable patterns in the long run. By understanding these relationships, analysts can make more accurate forecasts and predictions.

**Error Correction Models (ECM)**

ECMs are widely used in cointegration analysis. These models help capture short-term dynamics and adjust for deviations from long-term equilibrium.

## Implementing Johansen's cointegration test in EViews

Implementing Johansen's cointegration test in EViews is a valuable procedure for examining the existence and strength of cointegration relationships among multiple time series variables. Johansen's test is an extension of cointegration analysis beyond the simple bivariate case, allowing you to assess the long-term relationships between more than two variables. Here are the steps to perform Johansen's cointegration test in EViews:

**Open or Import Your Time Series Data**

Launch EViews and open the workfile where your time series data is stored. Ensure that you have imported or entered the variables you want to test for cointegration.

**View Your Time Series Data**

 In the workfile window, locate and click on the series representing your time series data. 

Open or view 2 or more variables in the workfile window which you intend to test for cointegration.

you can highlight multiple variables as shown below by clicking once on a series on the workfile environment, then you press and hold 'control botton' on you keyboard while you click on the remaining variables you intend to test for cointegration.

After highlighting the variables of interest as shown above, take your cursor to one of the highlighted variables left-click on your mouse and choose open,  as group.

This will open the series view as shown above.

**Perform the Johansen's Cointegration Test**

In the series view window, go to the menu bar at the top and select "View" "Cointegration" "Johansen Conitegration"

The dialog box below similar to the one below should appear on your screen. you can maintain the default settings. only change them if you have a strong justification for the change.

**Run the Test**

After selecting the Johansen test and any desired options, EViews will compute the test results when you click on ok
click ok to display the Johansen cointegretion test result.

**Interpret the Results**

Examine the results to determine whether there are cointegration relationships among the selected variables. Key information to look for includes:

The number of cointegration relationships: This indicates how many linearly independent cointegrating vectors exist among the variables.

Trace statistic and critical values: The trace statistic helps assess the significance of the cointegration relationships. Compare it to the critical values to make inferences.

Eigenvalues: These provide additional information about the cointegration relationships and can help determine the rank of the cointegration matrix.

**Make Inferences**

Based on the results, you can draw conclusions about the number and nature of cointegration relationships among your selected variables. If the trace statistic is greater than the critical values for a specific number of cointegration relationships, you can conclude that there is cointegration.

**Repeat and Explore**

You can perform Johansen's cointegration test with different variable combinations or lag specifications to explore the cointegration properties of your data further.

**Save Your Work**

If you want to keep a record of the Johansen's cointegration test and its results, consider saving the output window or exporting it to a file for future reference.

**Interpreting cointegration results**

Interpreting the results of a cointegration test is crucial for understanding the long-term relationships among time series variables. Cointegration tests determine whether multiple non-stationary time series are linearly dependent in the long run, indicating that they share a common stochastic trend. Here's how to interpret the key components of a cointegration test result:

**Number of Cointegration Relationships**

The cointegration test often provides information about the number of cointegration relationships detected. This is usually indicated by the rank of the cointegration matrix. Each cointegration relationship represents a linear combination of the original variables that is stationary. For example, if you have three variables and the test indicates one cointegration relationship, it means that there's one combination of the three variables that is stationary.

**Test Statistic (Trace Statistic)**

The trace statistic is a critical part of the cointegration test result. It measures the overall number of cointegration relationships and their significance.

The test statistic is compared to critical values from a statistical distribution to determine if the results are statistically significant. If the test statistic exceeds the critical values for a certain number of cointegration relationships, it suggests the presence of cointegration.

**Critical Values**

Cointegration tests provide critical values corresponding to different significance levels (e.g., 1%, 5%, 10%). These values serve as a benchmark for comparing the test statistic. If the test statistic exceeds the critical values at a particular significance level, it indicates that the cointegration relationships are statistically significant at that level.

**Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**

 In some cointegration tests, such as Johansen's test, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are provided. These are used to determine the number of cointegration relationships and the nature of those relationships.

Eigenvalues represent the characteristics of the cointegration matrix. The number of eigenvalues greater than zero corresponds to the number of cointegration relationships.

Eigenvectors describe the coefficients of the linear combinations that form the cointegration relationships. They can help you understand the specific relationship between the variables in each cointegration vector.

**Rank of the Cointegration Matrix**

The rank of the cointegration matrix is often mentioned explicitly. It corresponds to the number of cointegration relationships detected. For example, if the rank is 1, it suggests that there is one cointegration relationship among the variables.

**Implications**

Depending on the cointegration test results, you can draw conclusions about the long-term relationships among the variables. If the test indicates cointegration (i.e., the test statistic exceeds the critical values), it suggests that the variables are linked by a common stochastic trend.

Conversely, if the test does not indicate cointegration, it implies that the variables are not cointegrated, and they do not share a long-term relationship.

 **Practical Significance**:

In addition to statistical significance, consider the practical significance of cointegration relationships. Assess whether the detected relationships have economic or theoretical meaning and how they might be useful in modeling, forecasting, or policy analysis.Granger-causality tests for cointegrated series.

## Interpreting the Johansen result example

![](images/cointegration6result-01.png)

The johansen test in the dialog box above has three null hypothesis. the first is the null that there is no cointegrating equation or variables (None), the second test the null hypothesis that there is at most one cointegrating equation while the third null hypothesis is at most 2 cointegrating equations.

 **None**

The eigenvalue associated with this rank is 0.077562, and the Trace Statistic is 26.49554. The critical value at the 0.05 significance level is 29.79707. Since the Trace Statistic (26.49554) is less than the critical value (29.79707), you do not reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration. This suggests that there are no cointegrating relationships among the variables at the 0.05 significance level.

 **At most 1**
The eigenvalue for this rank is 0.041108, and the Trace Statistic is 9.379598. The critical value at the 0.05 significance level is 15.49471. Since the Trace Statistic (9.379598) is less than the critical value (15.49471), you do not reject the null hypothesis of at most 1 cointegrating equation.

**At most 2**
The eigenvalue for this rank is 0.002264, and the Trace Statistic is 0.480452. The critical value at the 0.05 significance level is 3.841466. Since the Trace Statistic (0.480452) is less than the critical value (3.841466), you do not reject the null hypothesis of at most 2 cointegrating equations.

The Trace test indicates no cointegration at the 0.05 significance level for any of the tested cointegration ranks. In other words, based on this test, there is no evidence of cointegration among the "BRENT GOLD USA" series and the specified lags intervals (1 to 3) during the given time period. The rejection of the hypothesis of cointegration suggests that the variables may not have long-term equilibrium relationships.
