# Data Transformation in EViews

In EViews, you can perform various transformations on time series data to preprocess it or make it suitable for econometric modeling, analysis, or forecasting. Here are some common time series transformations, including examples of logging variables, computing first differences, and calculating returns, along with other major transformations used in economics and finance:

## **Logging Variables:**

-   Logarithmic transformation is useful when dealing with data that exhibits exponential growth or has a multiplicative structure. It helps stabilize variance and linearize relationships.

-   To log a variable in EViews:

    -   Open the series view of the variable.

    -   Go to "Quick" > "Generate New Series."

    -   In the "Generate Series" dialog, select "Logs of Series" and choose the base (e.g., natural logarithm).

    -   Click "OK" to create the logged variable.

## **Computing First Differences (or Returns)**

-   First differencing is used to transform a time series into its rate of change over time. In finance, it's often used to calculate daily or periodic returns.

-   To compute the first differences in EViews:

    1.  Open the series view of the variable.

    2.  Go to "Quick" > "Generate New Series."

    3.  In the "Generate Series" dialog, select "Differences of Series."

    4.  Click "OK" to create the different variable.

        another way is from step 2 above:

    5.  decide a variable name for the series you intend to generate its first difference such as "dbrent"

    6.  type in box dbrent=d(brent)

    7.  a new series called dbrent is generated which is the first difference of the original variable brent.

        **Alternatively** , if you use older version of EViews,

    8.  Click on genr in the series view

    9.  a dialog box will appear.

    10. decide a variable name for the series you intend to generate its first difference such as "dbrent"

    11. type in box dbrent=d(brent)

    12. a new series called dbrent is generated which is the first difference of the original variable brent.

## **Seasonal Adjustment**

-   Seasonal adjustment is used to remove the seasonal component from a time series, allowing you to focus on underlying trends and irregular fluctuations.

-   In EViews, you can use the "Seasonal Adjustment" option in the "Quick" menu to apply seasonal adjustment methods.

## **Detrending**

-   Detrending is used to remove the trend component from a time series, making it stationary for analysis.

-   In EViews, you can create a detrended series by subtracting a trend series (e.g., a moving average or a polynomial fit) from the original series.

## **Exponential Smoothing**

-   Exponential smoothing techniques, such as simple exponential smoothing or Holt-Winters, are used for forecasting and smoothing noisy time series data.

-   You can apply exponential smoothing in EViews using the "Forecast" option.

## **Standardization (Z-Scores)**

-   Standardizing a variable involves transforming it into a z-score, which expresses the number of standard deviations it is from the mean.

-   To standardize a variable in EViews:

    -   Open the series view of the variable.

    -   Go to "Quick" -> "Generate New Series."

    -   In the "Generate Series" dialog, select "Standardized (z-scores) Series."

    -   Click "OK" to create the standardized variable.

## **Rolling Averages or Moving Averages**

-   Rolling averages are used to smooth out fluctuations and trends in data. You can compute moving averages of various lengths in EViews using the "Generate New Series" option.

## **Percentage Change**

-   Percentage change is used to express the relative change in a variable as a percentage.

-   You can calculate percentage change in EViews by taking the difference between two observations and dividing it by the original observation.

## **Lagging and Leading Variables**

-   Lagging and leading variables involve shifting a time series forward or backwards in time to analyze lags or leads in relationships.

-   In EViews, you can create lagged or leading variables using the "Generate New Series" option and specifying the lag or lead value.
